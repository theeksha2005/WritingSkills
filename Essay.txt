The day I met my soulmate
It was an usual Friday evening until I found out that I have left the umbrella in a cornermost lecture room in the last floor. 
I knew for sure that even if I would have a magical power to keep myself not getting wet amidst the heavy rain, there is no way that I could escape from my mother who was anxiously waiting the umbrella to return home.
Blaming Mr. Marcus for not winding up the lecture on time, I started walking along the narrow corridor which leads to the staircase.
I could not hear anything other than my own footsteps.
I was calm and quiet until I found out that I was walking slower than the footsteps which I earlier thought to be my own foot steps.

I felt nervous and turned to the side where the sound was coming from.
Oh! I shocked for a moment that I couldn't believe he was infront of me.
The personthat i loved the most and who I missed last 2 months was infront of me.
I ran to him and cuddled to him.
Oh! That was real!
